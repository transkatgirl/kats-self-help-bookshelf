## Contents

[Kat's Bookshelf](https://github.com/transkatgirl/kats-bookshelf/#readme) is a small, hand-curated collection of courses which will slowly grow over time. This is an offshoot of the primary bookshelf, with the goal of providing a collection of useful self-improvement books.

If you would like to suggest improvements to the collection (such as book recommendations), please [file an issue](https://github.com/transkatgirl/kats-self-help-bookshelf/issues).
